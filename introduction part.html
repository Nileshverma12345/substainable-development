    </h1><hr>
    <p>
        Sustainable development is an organizing
principle that aims to meet human development goals
while also enabling natural systems to provide
necessary natural resources and ecosystem services to
humans.The desired result is a society where living
conditions and resources meet human needs without
undermining the planetary integrity and stability of
the natural system.Sustainable development tries
to find a balance between economic development,
environmental protection, and social well-being. The
Brundtland Report in 1987 defined sustainable
development as "development that meets the needs of
the present generation without compromising the
ability of future generations to meet their own
needs".The concept of sustainable development
nowadays has a focus on economic development, social
development and environmental protection for future
generations.

        Sustainable development was first institutionalized with the Rio Process initiated at the 1992 Earth
        Summit in Rio de Janeiro. In 2015 the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) adopted the
        Sustainable Development Goals (2015 to 2030) and explained how the goals are integrated and
        indivisible to achieve sustainable development at the global level.The UNGA's 17 goals address
        the global challenges, including poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation,
        peace, and justice.

        Sustainable development is interlinked with the normative concept of sustainability. UNESCO
        formulated a distinction between the two concepts as follows: "Sustainability is often thought of as
        a long-term goal (i.e. a more sustainable world), while sustainable development refers to the many
        processes and pathways to achieve it."The concept of sustainable development has been
        criticized in various ways. While some see it as paradoxical (or as an oxymoron) and regard
        development as inherently unsustainable, others are disappointed in the lack of progress that has
        been achieved so far.Part of the problem is that "development" itself is not consistently
        defined.

    <h2>
        Definition
    </h2>
    <p>
        In 1987, the United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development released the
report Our Common Future, commonly called the Brundtland Report.
The report included a
definition of "sustainable development" which is now widely used:
    </p>
    <p>
        Sustainable development is a development that meets the needs of the present without
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It contains two
key concepts within it:
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>1.</b> The concept of 'needs', in particular, the essential needs of the world's poor, to
which overriding priority should be given; and</p>
<p><b>2.</b> The idea of limitations imposed by the state of technology and social organization
on the environment's ability to meet present and future needs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sustainable development thus tries to find a balance between economic development,
environmental protection, and social well-being.

        Sustainability is a social goal for people to co-exist on
        Earth over a long time. Specific definitions of this
        term are disputed and have varied with literature,
        context, and time.Experts often describe
        sustainability as having three dimensions (or pillars):
        environmental, economic, and social,and many
        publications emphasize the environmental
        dimension.

         In everyday use, sustainability
        often focuses on countering major environmental
        problems, including climate change, loss of
        biodiversity, loss of ecosystem services, land
        degradation, and air and water pollution. The idea of
        sustainability can guide decisions at the global,
        national, and individual levels (e.g. sustainable
        living).
         A related concept is sustainable
        development, and the terms are often used to mean
        the same thing.UNESCO distinguishes the two
        like this: "Sustainability is often thought of as a long-term goal (i.e. a more sustainable world), while
        sustainable development refers to the many
        processes and pathways to achieve it.
