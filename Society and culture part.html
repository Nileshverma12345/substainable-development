        Sustainable development goals
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) or Global Goals
        are a collection of seventeen interlinked objectives designed to
        serve as a "shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people
        and the planet, now and into the future."The short
        titles of the 17 SDGs are: No poverty (SDG 1), Zero hunger
        (SDG 2), Good health and well-being (SDG 3), Quality
        education (SDG 4), Gender equality (SDG 5), Clean water and
        sanitation (SDG 6), Affordable and clean energy (SDG 7),
        Decent work and economic growth (SDG 8), Industry,
        innovation and infrastructure (SDG 9), Reduced inequalities
        (SDG 10), Sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11),
        Responsible consumption and production (SDG 12), Climate action (SDG 13), Life below water
        (SDG 14), Life on land (SDG 15), Peace, justice, and strong institutions (SDG 16), and Partnerships
        for the goals (SDG 17).

        The SDGs emphasize the interconnected environmental, social and economic aspects of
        sustainable development by putting sustainability at their center.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2015, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) created the SDGs as part of the Post-2015
Development Agenda. This agenda sought to design a new global development framework,
replacing the Millennium Development Goals, which were completed that same year.[
 These
goals were formally articulated and adopted in a UNGA resolution known as the 2030 Agenda,
often informally referred to as Agenda 2030.On 6 July 2017, the SDGs were made more
actionable by a UNGA resolution that identifies specific targets for each goal and provides
indicators to measure progress.
 Most targets are to be achieved by 2030, although some have
no end date.

        Education for sustainable development
    </h2>
    <p>
        Education for sustainable development (ESD) is a term officially used by the United Nations and is
        defined as education practices that encourage changes in knowledge, skills, values and attitudes to
        enable a more sustainable and just society for humanity. ESD aims to empower and equip current
        and future generations to meet their needs using a balanced and integrated approach to the
        economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development.
    </p>
    <p>
    Agenda 21 was the first international document that identified education as an essential tool for
achieving sustainable development and highlighted areas of action for education.ESD is a
component of measurement in an indicator for Sustainable Development Goal 12 (SDG) for
"responsible consumption and production". SDG 12 has 11 targets and target 12.8 is "By 2030,
ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable
development and lifestyles in harmony with nature."20 years after the Agenda 21 document
was declared, the 'Future we want' document was declared in the Rio+20 UN Conference on
Sustainable Development, stating that "We resolve to promote education for sustainable
development and to integrate sustainable development more actively into education beyond the
Decade of Education for Sustainable Development."
    </p>
    <p>
    One version of education for Sustainable Development recognizes modern-day environmental
challenges and seeks to define new ways to adjust to a changing biosphere, as well as engage
individuals to address societal issues that come with them
In the International Encyclopedia
of Education, this approach to education is seen as an attempt to "shift consciousness toward an
ethics of life-giving relationships that respects the interconnectedness of man to his natural world"
in order to equip future members of society with environmental awareness and a sense of
responsibility to sustainability.
    </p>
    <p>
    For UNESCO, education for sustainable development involves:
    </p>
    <p>
    integrating key sustainable development issues into teaching and learning. This may
include, for example, instruction about climate change, disaster risk reduction,
biodiversity, and poverty reduction and sustainable consumption. It also requires
participatory teaching and learning methods that motivate and empower learners to
change their behaviours and take action for sustainable development. ESD
consequently promotes competencies like critical thinking, imagining future scenarios
and making decisions in a collaborative way.
