    <h2>Requirments
    </h2>
    <p>
        Six interdependent capacities are deemed to be necessary for the successful pursuit of sustainable
development.These are the capacities to measure progress towards sustainable development;
promote equity within and between generations; adapt to shocks and surprises; transform the
system onto more sustainable development pathways; link knowledge with action for
sustainability; and to devise governance arrangements that allow people to work together.
    </p>
    <h2>
       1. Environmental characteristics of sustainable cities
    </h2>
    <p>
        A sustainable city is an urban center that improves its environmental impact through urban
planning and management. For the definition of an eco-city, imagine a city with parks and green
spaces, solar-powered buildings, rooftop gardens, and more pedestrians and bicycles than cars.
This is not a futuristic dream. Smart cities are actively moving towards greener urban ecosystems
and better environmental management.
    </p>
    <p>
        Environmental sustainability concerns the natural
        environment and how it endures and remains diverse and
        productive. Since natural resources are derived from the
        environment, the state of air, water, and climate is of particular
        concern. Environmental sustainability requires society to
        design activities to meet human needs while preserving the life
        support systems of the planet. This, for example, entails using
        water sustainably, using renewable energy and sustainable
        material supplies (e.g. harvesting wood from forests at a rate
        that maintains the biomass and biodiversity).
        
    </p>
    <p>
        An unsustainable situation occurs when natural capital (the
total of nature's resources) is used up faster than it can be
replenished.Sustainability requires that human activity
only uses nature's resources at a rate at which they can be
replenished naturally. The concept of sustainable development
is intertwined with the concept of carrying capacity.
Theoretically, the long-term result of environmental
degradation is the inability to sustain human life.
    </p>
    <p>
        Important operational principles of sustainable development were published by Herman Daly in
        1990: renewable resources should provide a sustainable yield (the rate of harvest should not
        exceed the rate of regeneration); for non-renewable resources there should be equivalent
        development of renewable substitutes; waste generation should not exceed the assimilative
        capacity of the environment.
    </p>
    <h2>
    2. Land use changes, agriculture and food
    </h2>
    <p>
        Environmental problems associated with industrial agriculture and agribusiness are now being
addressed through approaches such as sustainable agriculture, organic farming and more
sustainable business practices.
The most cost-effective climate change mitigation optionsinclude afforestation, sustainable forest management, and reducing deforestation.
At the local
level there are various movements working towards sustainable food systems which may include
less meat consumption, local food production, slow food, sustainable gardening, and organic
gardening.
The environmental effects of different dietary patterns depend on many factors,
including the proportion of animal and plant foods consumed and the method of food
production.
    </p>
    <h2>
       3. Materials and waste
    </h2>
    <p>
        As global population and affluence have
increased, so has the use of various
materials increased in volume, diversity,
and distance transported. Included here
are raw materials, minerals, synthetic
chemicals (including hazardous
substances), manufactured products,
food, living organisms, and waste.By
2050, humanity could consume an
estimated 140 billion tons of minerals,
ores, fossil fuels and biomass per year
(three times its current amount) unless
the economic growth rate is decoupled
from the rate of natural resource
consumption. Developed countries'
citizens consume an average of 16 tons of
those four key resources per capita per
year, ranging up to 40 or more tons per
person in some developed countries with resource
consumption levels far beyond what is likely sustainable. By
comparison, the average person in India today consumes four
tons per year.

    <p>
        Sustainable use of materials has targeted the idea of
        dematerialization, converting the linear path of materials
        (extraction, use, disposal in landfill) to a circular material flow
        that reuses materials as much as possible, much like the cycling
        and reuse of waste in nature.Dematerialization is being
        encouraged through the ideas of industrial ecology, eco
        design
         and ecolabelling.
    </p>
    <p>
        This way of thinking is expressed in the concept of circular
economy, which employs reuse, sharing, repair, refurbishment,
remanufacturing and recycling to create a closed-loop system, minimizing the use of resource
inputs and the creation of waste, pollution and carbon emissions.Building electric vehicles has
been one of the most popular ways in the field of sustainable development, the potential of using
reusable energy and reducing waste offered a perspective in sustainable development.The
European Commission has adopted an ambitious Circular Economy Action Plan in 2020, which
aims at making sustainable products the norm in the EU.
    </p>
    <h2>
       4. Biodiversity and ecosystem services
    </h2>
    <p>
        There is a connection between ecosystems and biodiversity. Ecosystems are made up of various
living things interacting with one another and their surroundings. Along with this, biodiversity lays
the groundwork for ecosystems to function well by defining the kinds of species that can coexist in
an environment, as well as their functions and interactions with other species.
In 2019, a
summary for policymakers of the largest, most comprehensive study to date of biodiversity and
ecosystem services was published by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on
Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. It recommended that human civilization will need a
transformative change, including sustainable agriculture, reductions in consumption and waste,
fishing quotas and collaborative water management.Biodiversity is not only crucial for the
well-being of animals and wildlife but also plays a positive role in the lives of human beings in the
way in which it aids development of human life.
    </p>
    <h2>
      5.  Management of human consumption and impacts
    </h2>
    <p>
The environmental impact of a community or humankind as a
whole depends both on population and impact per person,
which in turn depends in complex ways on what resources are
being used, whether or not those resources are renewable, and
the scale of the human activity relative to the carrying capacity
of the ecosystems involved.Careful resource management
can be applied at many scales, from economic sectors like
agriculture, manufacturing and industry, to work
organizations, the consumption patterns of households and
individuals, and the resource demands of individual goods and
services.
    </p>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Waste_generation_per_day_per_capita%2C_September_2018.jpg/1200px-Waste_generation_per_day_per_capita%2C_September_2018.jpg">
    <p>
        The underlying driver of direct human impacts on the environment is human consumption.
This impact is reduced by not only consuming less but also making the full cycle of production, use,
and disposal more sustainable. Consumption of goods and services can be analyzed and managed
at all scales through the chain of consumption, starting with the effects of individual lifestyle
choices and spending patterns, through to the resource demands of specific goods and services, the
impacts of economic sectors, through national economies to the global economy.Key resource
categories relating to human needs are food, energy, raw materials and water.

    <h2>
       6. Improving on economic and social aspects
    </h2>
    <p>
        It has been suggested that because of rural poverty and overexploitation, environmental resources
should be treated as important economic assets, called natural capital.
Economic development
has traditionally required a growth in the gross domestic product. This model of unlimited
personal and GDP growth may be over. Sustainable development may involve improvements in the
quality of life for many but may necessitate a decrease in resource consumption.
"Growth"
generally ignores the direct effect that the environment may have on social welfare, whereas
"development" takes it into account.
    </p>
    <p>
        As early as the 1970s, the concept of sustainability was used to describe an economy "in
equilibrium with basic ecological support systems".[74] Scientists in many fields have highlighted
The Limits to Growth,
and economists have presented alternatives, for example a 'steady state economy', to address concerns over the impacts of expanding human development on the
planet.
In 1987, the economist Edward Barbier published the study The Concept of Sustainable
Economic Development, where he recognized that goals of environmental conservation and
economic development are not conflicting and can be reinforcing each other.
    </p>
    <p>
        A World Bank study from 1999 concluded that based on the theory of genuine savings (defined as
"traditional net savings less the value of resource depletion and environmental degradation plus
the value of investment in human capital"), policymakers have many possible interventions to
increase sustainability, in macroeconomics or purely environmental.Several studies have noted
that efficient policies for renewable energy and pollution are compatible with increasing human
welfare, eventually reaching a golden-rule steady state.
    </p>
    <p>
        A meta review in 2002 looked at environmental and economic valuations and found a "lack of
concrete understanding of what "sustainability policies" might entail in practice".A study
concluded in 2007 that knowledge, manufactured and human capital (health and education) has
not compensated for the degradation of natural capital in many parts of the world.[84]
It has been
suggested that intergenerational equity can be incorporated into a sustainable development and
decision making, as has become common in economic valuations of climate economics.
    </p>
<p>
    The World Business Council for Sustainable Development published a Vision 2050 document in
2021 to show "How business can lead the transformations the world needs". The vision states that
"we envision a world in which 9+billion people can live well, within planetary boundaries, by
2050."This report was highlighted by The Guardian as "the largest concerted corporate
sustainability action plan to date – include reversing the damage done to ecosystems, addressing
rising greenhouse gas emissions and ensuring societies move to sustainable agriculture.
</p>
<h2>
    Gender and leadership in sustainable development
</h2>
<p>
    Gender and sustainable development have been examined, focusing on women's leadership
potential and barriers to it. While leadership roles in sustainable development have become more
androgynous over time, patriarchal structures and perceptions continue to constrain women from
becoming leaders.Some hidden issues are women's lack of self-confidence, impeding access to
leadership roles, but men can potentially play a role as allies for women's leadership.
