        Sustainable development has its roots in ideas regarding sustainable forest management, which
were developed in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries.
In response to a growing
awareness of the depletion of timber resources in England, John Evelyn argued, in his 1662 essay
Sylva, that "sowing and planting of trees had to be regarded as a national duty of every landowner,
in order to stop the destructive over-exploitation of natural resources." In 1713, Hans Carl von
Carlowitz, a senior mining administrator in the service of Elector Frederick Augustus I of Saxony
published Sylvicultura economics, a 400-page work on forestry. Building upon the ideas of Evelyn
and French minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert, von Carlowitz developed the concept of managing
forests for sustained yield.
His work influenced others, including Alexander von Humboldt and
Georg Ludwig Hartig, eventually leading to the development of the science of forestry. This, in
turn, influenced people like Gifford Pinchot, the first head of the US Forest Service, whose
approach to forest management was driven by the idea of wise use of resources, and Aldo Leopold
whose land ethic was influential in the development of the environmental movement in the
1960s.

        Following the publication of Rachel Carson's Silent Spring in 1962, the developing environmental
movement drew attention to the relationship between economic growth and environmental
degradation. Kenneth E. Boulding, in his influential 1966 essay The Economics of the Coming
Spaceship Earth, identified the need for the economic system to fit itself to the ecological system
with its limited pools of resources.Another milestone was the 1968 article by Garrett Hardin
that popularized the term "tragedy of the commons".

        The direct linking of sustainability and development in a contemporary sense can be traced to the
early 1970s. "Strategy of Progress", a 1972 book (in German) by Ernst Basler, explained how the
long-acknowledged sustainability concept of preserving forests for future wood production can be
directly transferred to the broader importance of preserving environmental resources to sustain
the world for future generations.That same year, the interrelationship of environment and
development was formally demonstrated in a systems dynamic simulation model reported in the
classic report on Limits to Growth. It was commissioned by the Club of Rome and written by a
group of scientists led by Dennis and Donella Meadows of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. Describing the desirable "state of global equilibrium", the authors wrote: "We are
searching for a model output that represents a world system that is sustainable without sudden
and uncontrolled collapse and capable of satisfying the basic material requirements of all of its
people."
 Also in 1972 was publication of the influential book, A Blueprint for Survival.

        In 1975, an MIT research group prepared ten days of hearings on "Growth and Its Implication for
the Future" for the US Congress, the first hearings ever held on sustainable development.

        In 1980, the International Union for Conservation of Nature published a world conservation
strategy that included one of the first references to sustainable development as a global priority[29]
and introduced the term "sustainable development".[30]:4 Two years later, the United Nations
World Charter for Nature raised five principles of conservation by which human conduct affecting
nature is to be guided and judged.

        Since the Brundtland Report, the concept of sustainable development has developed beyond the
initial intergenerational framework to focus more on the goal of "socially inclusive and
environmentally sustainable economic growth".
In 1992, the UN Conference on Environment
and Development published the Earth Charter, which outlines the building of a just, sustainable,
and peaceful global society in the 21st century. The action plan Agenda 21 for sustainable
development identified information, integration, and participation as key building blocks to help
countries achieve development that recognizes these interdependent pillars. Furthermore, Agenda
21 emphasizes that broad public participation in decision-making is a fundamental prerequisite for
achieving sustainable development.

        The Rio Protocol was a huge leap forward: for the first time, the world agreed on a sustainability
agenda. In fact, a global consensus was facilitated by neglecting concrete goals and operational
details. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) now have concrete targets (unlike the results
from the Rio Process) but no methods for sanctions.
