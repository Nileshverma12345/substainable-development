        Sustainable development, like sustainability, is regarded to have three dimensions: the
environment, economy and society. The idea is that a good balance between the three dimensions
should be achieved. Instead of calling them dimensions, other terms commonly used are pillars,
domains, aspects, spheres.

        Scholars usually distinguish three different areas of sustainability. These are the environmental,
the social, and the economic. Several terms are in use for this concept. Authors may speak of three
pillars, dimensions, components, aspects,[34] perspectives, factors, or goals. All mean the same thing in this context.[13] The three dimensions paradigm has
few theoretical foundations. It emerged without a single point
of origin.[13][35] Scholars rarely question the distinction itself.
The idea of sustainability with three dimensions is a dominant
interpretation in the literature.
