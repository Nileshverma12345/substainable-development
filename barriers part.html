        There are barriers that small and medium enterprises face when implementing sustainable
        development such as lack of expertise, lack of resources, and high initial capital cost of
        implementing sustainability measures.

        Globally, the scale of collective action and lack of political will are barriers to achieving sustainable
        development.To overcome these challenges, governments must jointly form an agreement
        of social and political strength. Efforts to enact reforms or design and implement programs to
        decrease the harmful effects of human behaviors allow for progress toward present and future
        environmental sustainability goals.The Paris Agreement exemplifies efforts of political will on a
        global level, a multinational agreement between 193 parties 
        intended to strengthen the global
        response to climate change by reducing emissions and working together to adjust to the
        consequent effects of climate change.
        Experts continue to firmly suggest that governments
        should do more outside of The Paris Agreement, there persist a greater need for political will.

        Another barrier towards sustainable development would be negative externalities that may
potentially arise from implementing sustainable development technology. One example would be
the development of lithium-ion batteries, a key element towards environmental sustainability and
the reduction in reliance towards fossil fuels. However, currently with the technology and
methodology available, Lithium production poses a negative environmental impact during its
extraction from the earth as it uses a method very similar to fracking as well as during its
processing to be used as a battery which is a chemically intensive process.One suggested
solution would be to weigh the possibility of recycling as this will cut down on the waste of old 
lithium as well as reducing the need for extracting new lithium from the ground, however, this
sustainable development solution is barred from implementation by a high initial cost as studies
have shown that recycling old technology for the purpose of extracting metals such as lithium and
cobalt is typically more expensive than extracting them from the ground and processing them

        Taking into account the pandemic is also something that needs to be considered in the SDG
process. Especially for developing countries exposed to social problems affected by COVID-19, the
connection between post-epidemic recovery and SDG needs to be discussed and studied.The
COVID-19 pandemic has provided substantial roadblocks towards achieving Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs). While the long-term effects of COVID-19 on SDGs is limited, research
has shown that SDG 1, SDG 4, and SDG 8 are the most likely to be adversely affected by the
pandemic. One of the strategies proposed towards SDG in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic is
green management, or the government strategy of utilizing resources such as water and energy
with the intention to change resource consumption behavior. Other strategies include erecting
sustainable food systems, labor market energization, inclusive education, and supporting research
in the energy sector.
