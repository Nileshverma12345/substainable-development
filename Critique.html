        The concept of sustainable development has been and still is, subject to criticism, including the
question of what is to be sustained in sustainable development. It has been argued that there is no
such thing as sustainable use of a non-renewable resource, since any positive rate of exploitation
will eventually lead to the exhaustion of earth's finite stock;[37]:13 this perspective renders the
Industrial Revolution as a whole unsustainable.

        The sustainable development debate is based on the assumption that societies need to manage
three types of capital (economic, social, and natural), which may be non-substitutable and whose
consumption might be irreversible.Natural capital can not necessarily be substituted by
economic capital.While it is possible that we can find ways to replace some natural resources,
it is much less likely that they will ever be able to replace ecosystem services, such as the protection
provided by the ozone layer, or the climate stabilizing function of the Amazonian forest.

        The concept of sustainable development has been criticized from different angles. While some see
it as paradoxical (or an oxymoron) and regard development as inherently unsustainable, others are
disappointed in the lack of progress that has been achieved so far.Part of the problem is that
"development" itself is not consistently defined.Such a viewpoint contradicts the
mainstream academic community, which frequently concedes that the processes of capitalism are
incompatible with the long-term sustainability of human life.

        The vagueness of the Brundtland definition of sustainable development has been criticized as
follows:The definition has "opened up the possibility of downplaying sustainability. Hence,
governments spread the message that we can have it all at the same time, i.e. economic growth,
prospering societies and a healthy environment. No new ethic is required. This so-called weak
version of sustainability is popular among governments, and businesses, but profoundly wrong and
not even weak, as there is no alternative to preserving the earth's ecological integrity."
